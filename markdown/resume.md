PolyPhone
:   Project started during course work in university but far to passionate to be
restricted by it.
Mission was to create a phone from detailed not targeted for a phone.
This way we were not able to use some android ready Chinese board.
Due to a negative amount of available time, the project died a horrible death.

	Things involved:

    * RaspberryPi zero (and 3 as a devstack)
	* SIM808
	* Some Chinese screen, battery, charge controller
	* Power and buttons controller (Digispark)
	* 3D printed body and buttons
	* Badly wired motherboard (not even printed)
	* Social media accounts ([Instagram](https://instagram.com/phone3141592)
	and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhonePi))
	* Archlinux ARM
	* Custom Window Manager
	* Custom Boot Animation (Plymouth)
	* Custom Suite of Phone applications (Qt and oFono)
	* Hosted Archlinux repository to push updates

Open Source contribution
:   * [Frost](https://github.com/dkanada/frost) Android Icon pack. Just for fun
	* [zmNinja](https://github.com/wrabbitaz/zmNinja/tree/double_def_fix) cross platform app for ZoneMinder
	* [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) Local Kubernetes
	* [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) Allows to build container images wo docker service
